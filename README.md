Driver Drowsiness Detection System Using Python
This project implements a Driver Drowsiness Detection System using Python. The system uses real-time computer vision and deep learning techniques to monitor a driver's face, track their eye movements, and detect signs of drowsiness, such as blinking or yawning. If drowsiness is detected, the system will issue a warning to alert the driver.

Features
Face Detection: Detects the driver's face using OpenCV.
Eye Tracking: Tracks eye movements to monitor blinking rate and detect potential drowsiness.
Yawning Detection: Detects yawning, another indicator of drowsiness.
Alert System: Sends an alert (visual or auditory) when drowsiness is detected.
Real-time Processing: The system works in real-time using a webcam feed.
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

Python (version 3.6 or higher)
OpenCV: For face and eye detection.
dlib: For detecting facial landmarks.
imutils: For image processing.
Keras / TensorFlow: For deep learning models (if any).
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Pygame: For alert sounds (optional).
You can install the required libraries by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install opencv-python dlib imutils numpy pygame
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System-Using-Python.git
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the system:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project folder and run the Python script:
bash
Copy code
python drowsiness_detection.py
Testing:

The system will open a webcam feed and begin monitoring for drowsiness.
If drowsiness (blinking or yawning) is detected, an alert will be triggered.
How It Works
Face and Eye Detection: The system uses Haar Cascades or dlib to detect the driver's face and eyes in real-time.
Blinking Detection: The ratio of eye aspect is calculated. If the eyes remain closed for a significant period, the system detects blinking and potential drowsiness.
Yawning Detection: The mouth aspect ratio is used to detect yawns.
Alerting the Driver: If the system detects drowsiness, it sends a visual or auditory alert to warn the driver.
